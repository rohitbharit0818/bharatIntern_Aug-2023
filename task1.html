            <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines
                that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning,
                problem-solving, speech recognition, decision-making, and more.</p>
            <p>AI is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including
                healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.</p>

            <h2>The Different Types of AI</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of AI:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Also known as Weak AI, this type of AI is designed to perform specific
                    tasks and is not capable of general intelligence. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and
                    Alexa.</li>
                <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Also known as Strong AI, this type of AI would have the ability to
                    understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different tasks, similar to human intelligence. It is
                    still a theoretical concept and does not exist yet.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence:</strong> This refers to an AI system that surpasses human
                    intelligence in virtually every aspect. It is also a theoretical concept and the subject of much
                    debate and speculation.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Impact of AI on Society</h2>
            <p>The widespread adoption of AI technologies is expected to have a profound impact on society. Some of the
                potential benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased efficiency in various industries</li>
                <li>Improved healthcare and medical diagnoses</li>
                <li>Enhanced personalization in marketing and entertainment</li>
                <li>Automation of repetitive tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, AI also raises important ethical and societal concerns, such as privacy issues, job
                displacement, and biases in AI decision-making.</p>
